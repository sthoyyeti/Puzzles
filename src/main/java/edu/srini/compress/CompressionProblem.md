Warning! This sequence can make you ill. The reasoning is simple but unusual: Read a line aloud whilst looking at the line above and you will notice that each line (except the first) makes ​​an inventory of the previous line.

Line 3 shows 2 1 because the line 2 contains two 1, one after the other.
Line 4 displays 1 2 1 1 because the line 3 contains a one 2 followed by a one 1.
Line 5 displays 1 1 1 2 2 1 because the line 4 contains a one 1 followed by a one 2 followed by a two 1.

This sequence refers to a technique used to encode ranges in order to compress identical values ​​without losing any information. This type of method is used, amongst others, to compress images.

Your mission is to write a program that will display the line L of this series on the basis of an original number R (R vaut 1 in our example).
INPUT:
Line 1: The original number R of the sequence.
Line 2: The line L to display. The index of the first line is 1.
 
OUTPUT: The line L of the sequence. Each element of the sequence is separated by a blank space.
 
CONSTRAINTS:

0 < R < 100
0 < L ≤ 25
 
EXAMPLE:
Input
1
6
Output
3 1 2 2 1 1
